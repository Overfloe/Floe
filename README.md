My own fork of [Floe](http://floe.codeplex.com/).

CHANGES:
* Bug fixes, enhancements, and UI improvements from other forks.
* UI changes that make sense to me at least.
* Support for ZNC 1.2/1.4 server-time-iso. (But notably not IRC 3.2 server-time or anything else from IRC 3.)
* Partial support for the ZNC \*buffextras module.
